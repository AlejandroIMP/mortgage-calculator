## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS



### What I learned

I have learned a lot about DOM manipulation, 
I have done the solution with pure javascript, which has helped me a lot to practice my logic for DOM manipulation and to use it better. 

The documentation for html, css and javascript has been very helpful, I have been able to practice searching through all the documentation for the relevant information that I need at different times.

### Continued development

I need to keep working and improving my JavaScript, and be able to use it to use libraries and frameworks.

I need to practice by developing more projects, finding new methods and new solutions, and opening my mind to everything that might be possible.

### Useful resources

- [documentation HTML input number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) - This helped me for complete all the function of the inputs.
